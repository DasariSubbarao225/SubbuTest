# Basic Next.js App Structure

This directory contains the essential folders and files for a Next.js application.

## Directory Structure
- `pages/`: Contains the pages of the application. The entry point is `index.js`, which serves as the homepage.
- `components/`: Contains React components that can be reused throughout the application.
- `styles/`: Contains CSS or SASS files to style the application.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the homepage.
